#Challenge Two

In our lecture I have covered Scapy, a python library with multiple uses. 

Using Scapy I'd like everyone to create a program that will send a syn flood to a desginated IP Address and port that is taken in via command line (ARGC ARGV). 

Please E-mail your code to Chris@Doege.pw for review, pointers or help.
